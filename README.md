# bloodthief-wasm-autosplitter

An autosplitter for Bloodthief written in Rust using the asr crate for LiveSplitOne - NOT LiveSplit

## Features:

The autosplitter:
- tracks your igt
- automatically starts the timer
- splits on:
  - checkpoint
  - key
  - first secret
  - finish


## Usage

Grab the latest release from [here](https://github.com/olvior/bloodthief-wasm-autosplitter/releases/latest)

I would recommend using [LiveSplitOne Druid by AlexKnauth](https://github.com/AlexKnauth/livesplit-one-druid/releases/latest)

For Linux you have to give livesplit the access to read other programs' memory.

NOTE: Windows isn't actually supported at the moment but it's something I'll try do later
